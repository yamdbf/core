	/**
	 * Method recommended to be implemented for resolving data without side-effects.
	 * Where `resolve()` should throw errors which will be sent to Discord when
	 * a value cannot be resolved, this method should simply return `undefined`.
	 *
	 * All base resolvers will implement this method with this signature so that
	 * they can be accessed for personal use via `<Client>.resolvers.get('resolver
	 * name or alias')`.
	 *
	 * Some resolvers require additional context in the form of a partial {@link Message}
	 * object in order to be able to resolve their data type from the given input
	 * (like needing a guild from the message to be able to resolve a `GuildMember`
	 * via the `Member` resolver). It's safest to assume that all base resolvers will
	 * want this context reference as only a small handful do not (specifically String,
	 * Number, Duration, Command, and CommandGroup). In the case of your own custom
	 * resolvers, you should know what needs context and what doesn't, so you can get
	 * away with passing as needed there.
	 *
	 * In cases where a full Message object is unavailable but context is known,
	 * if you have a Guild instance, for example, you can simply pass it like
	 * ```
	 * let resolved = <Resolver>.resolveRaw(value, { guild });
	 * ```
	 * This is fine for all base resolvers, as the most any of them expect from
	 * the context is for it to contain a `guild` field with a Guild instance,
	 * and they will throw an error if the context they require is missing.
	 *
	 * >Can be async
	 * @abstract
	 * @param {string} value String value to resolve data from
	 * @param {Partial<Message>} [context] Partial Discord.js Message object
